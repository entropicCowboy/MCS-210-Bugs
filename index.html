    <h2 id="AboutBugs" style="color:blue;"><sup>1. </sup>About Bugs</h2>
    <p style="font-size:100%;"> What do you think about bugs? Sorry, I didn't care enough to bother implementing a submission feature, so, you'll have to
        listen to what I have to say about them instead. I will say that the environment in which I find a bug has much influence over my reaction to it.
        Bugs are not my favorite of living things (are they animals? classified as something else?), but I recognize their importance for sustaining the
        environment. Nevertheless, I cannot allow this fact to suspend their death sentence are they to wander inside my home--but I am so kind as to
        let those within close vicinity live if I'm outside.
    </p>
    <p> Why do the majority of people find bugs creepy or gross? Is it because on hardly any other creatures do we find a large assortment of <mark>hairy</mark>
        legs or bulging eyes? The reason we find certain animals cute is because our brains have evolved to hold affection for certain attributes as means for
        instilling a desire to protect our own young (I think), so perhaps it is truly because humans themselves do not look at all alike to these creatures
        that we find them so undesireable. Also, it annoys me when people chide others for aggressively avoiding bugs, raising the point that they can't
        harm you or "they're more scared of you than you are of them." It's not that I am afraid of cicadas or centipedes, it's that I find them disgusting
        and don't wish to fraternize with their kind.

    <!-- a quick rant about flies -->
    <p> I find flies infuriatingly stupid. They are harmless creatures, but they're exasperating to deal with due to their innate habit of repeatedly landing
        on you, despite constant attempts to swat them away, and their incredible evasive manuevers when you finally decide intent on killing the
        <del>bastards</del> pests.
        This, for me, goes against reason.
        <br>
        <blockquote style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.3);">
            Why do they continually risk their life to land on you when you do not provide any sustenance or shelter for them? Their decision to make
            your arm their new landing ground does not provide any benefits to them but actually endangers them. Shouldn't it be in their nature to
            avoid attempts made on their life? Yet, even after narrowly avoiding the weight of a heavily descending book, they once again take the risk
            to be your pet. Evolution certainly didn't work the way I thought it would have, instilling an almost seemingly masochistic nature in
            flies--furthermore, I can think of no reason for them to perform drive bys on our ears aside from sadistic gratification.
            Isn't this annoying to the flies also? Would they not rather land on a stationary object so to avoid repeatedly flying away from our attacks?
            I'd think all animals/insects(/bugs? are they the same thing?) to partake in the rule of choosing the path of least resistance, so why do
            they still land on moving creatures after being exposed to animals' reluctance to oblige them? My inability to comprehend the reason for
            their actions is another reason why I hate these idiotic creatures with every fiber of my being. Another, is that I used to work in an
            ice cream shop, and the stupid little things kept dive bombing into the cups before I'd mix them.
        </blockquote>
        <div style="text-align:center;">Then again, maybe I'd be suicidal if I looked like that too.

    <div id="WorstBugs" style="color:Tomato;"><b>A brief list of the top 5 worst bugs I have encountered:</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cockroaches:</b> there is no solution other than to leave the area. Luckily, the only time I've seen one was during a class trip
                to Costa Rica, so I was able to leave the entire country.
            </li>
            <li><b>Millipedes/Centipedes:</b> these are the same in my head. These nasty little worms with legs are capable of traversing your entire
                wall in 3 seconds and are reclusive, making it incredibly difficult to rest easy once they instantaneously disappear on sight and are
                never seen again.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cicadas:</b> the flying carcasses and ubiquitous buzzing in the summer really are what secured them a spot here. Also, one time,
                during the peak of cicada season, my friend and I went to use her trampoline and on landing the first jump, 100+ cicada shells
                emerged from underneath the trampoline skirt, rolling down to our feet. But, that's a memory I'd rather keep supressed.</li>
            <li><b>Drain Flies:</b> these guys aren't too revolting, but I think it's their presence in bathrooms, the place you go to
                get clean, that makes me so uncomfortable. Their resistance is also unappealing; I think my bathroom had them on 3
                separate occacions within my last year of living at home.</li>
            <li><b>Lice:</b> okay, so technically, I haven't yet found these anywhere. BUT, the fear of finding one in my hair is one that
                constantly looms over me. Not only may you have to shave your head--or at the least pull those little wretches out with a comb
                and watch them wriggle about--but you might have to shave your pets, or replace all of your bedding and furniture.</li>

                writing about myself or food (I mean, I always find myself fascinating, but I thought I'd take into account the interests of the audience).
